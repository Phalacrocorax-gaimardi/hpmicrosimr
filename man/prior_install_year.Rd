prior_install_year(failure_year, tech, initial_year = 2015, params)
}
\arguments{
\item{failure_year}{year of system replacement}

year

\description{
samples the likely year of installation given that the system was replaced in failure_year
}
\details{
based on the posterior probability that heating system was installed in year T1 given that it failed in year T2 using
a non-uniform prior that the system was installed in 2015 or before. This ensures that initial_agents() has heating systems installed before the initial year.
